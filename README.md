# Group14_Final_Project

In our final project for Data Visualisation and Story Telling we want to explore song features and attributes based on data from Spotify using R and Tableau. 

## Background
- Music is one of the biggest and most important industries that unites people all over the world
- Both the music industry as well as songs and artists are continuously changing over time
- Spotify as one of the biggest music streaming platform of today's world, allows us to listen to music whenever and wherever we like
- At the same time, Spotify offers a vast amount of data on what people listen to and how different songs are composed 

## Objectives
- To better understand the music taste of the five of us :-)
- To understand what makes a song and an artist popular and what attributes songs from different genres typically have
- To investigate differences in music tastes among different countries
- To investigate the evolution of music tastes over the past 100 years
- To predict the popularity of songs using supervised machine learning techniques 

## Potential visualisations
- Analysis of different genres according to their song features (e.g. danceability, acousticness, tempo, song length)
- Popularity / song evolution of artists over time ("Where are they now?")
- Differences in today's music tastes of UK, China, Italy, South Africa & Germany
- Spotify's most frequent users

## Data
- Extract data from specific playlists through the Spotify API using Python (https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)
