Pull up, skrrt-skrrt on your body
Performin' just like my 'Rari
You're too fine
Need a ticket
I bet you taste expensive
Pouring up, up by the liter
If you keeping up you's a keeper
Tequila and vodka
Girl, you might be a problem

Run away, run away, run away, run away, I know that I should
But my heart wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay now
You can see it in my eyes
That I wanna take you down right now if I could
So I hope you know what I mean when I say

Let me take you dancin'
Two-step to the bedroom
We don't need no dance floor
Let me see your best move
Anythin' could happen
Ever since I met you
No need to imagine
Baby all I'm asking
Is let me take you dancing

Like da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da

Pull up, skrrt-skrrt on your body
There's just us two in this party
That Louis, that Prada
Looks so much better off ya
Turn me up, up, up, be my waitress
Know we not in love, so let's make it
Tequila and vodka
Girl, you might be a problem

Run away, run away, run away, run away, I know that I should (Know that I should)
But my heart wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay now
You can see it in my eyes
That I wanna take you down right now if I could
So I hope you know what I mean when I say

Let me take you dancin'
Two-step to the bedroom
We don't need no dance floor
Let me see your best move
Anythin' could happen
Ever since I met you
No need to imagine
Baby all I'm asking
Is let me take you dancing
