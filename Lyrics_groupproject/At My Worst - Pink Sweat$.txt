Can I call you baby?
Can you be my friend?
Can you be my lover up until the very end?
Let me show you love, oh I don't pretend
Stick by my side even when the world is givin' in (Yeah)

Oh, oh, oh, don't
Don't you worry
I'll be there, whenever you want me

I need somebody who can love me at my worst
Know I'm not perfect but I hope you see my worth
'Cause it's only you, nobody new, I put you first
And for you, girl, I swear I'll do the worst

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

If you stay forever, let me hold your hand
I can fill those places in your heart no one else can
Let me show you love, oh I don't pretend (Yeah)
I'll be right here, baby, you know I'll sink or swim

Oh, oh, oh, don't
Don't you worry
I'll be there, whenever you want me

I need somebody who can love me at my worst
Know I'm not perfect but I hope you see my worth (Yeah)
'Cause it's only you, nobody new, I put you first (Put you first)
And for you, girl, I swear I'll do the worst

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

I need somebody who can love me at my worst
Know I'm not perfect but I hope you see my worth
'Cause it's only you, nobody new, I put you first
And for you, girl, I swear I'll do the worst
