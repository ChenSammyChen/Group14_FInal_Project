
I think we could do it if we tried
If only to say, you're mine
Sofia know that you and I
Shouldn't feel like a crime

I think we could do it if we tried
If only to say, you're mine
Sofia know that you and I
Shouldn't feel like a crime

You know
I'll do anything you ask me to
But oh my god
I think I'm in love with you

Standing here alone now
Think that we can drive around
I just want to say
How I love you with your hair down
Baby you don't got to fight
I'll be here til the end of time
Wishing that you were mine
Pull you in, it's alright

I think we could do it if we tried
If only to say, you're mine
Sofia know that you and I
Shouldn't feel like a crime

Honey, I don't want it to fade
There's things that I know could get in the way
But, I don't want to say goodbye
And I think that we could do it if we tried

I think we could do it if we tried
If only to say, you're mine
Sofia know that you and I
Shouldn't feel like a crime

I think we could do it if we tried
I think we could do it if we tried

Sofia know that you and I
Shouldn't feel like a crime
Sofia know that you and I
Shouldn't feel like a crime
